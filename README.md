# Diabetes_Prediction

In this project we are going to analyze the data given and build a classification model:
   * predict whether a person is diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning
   * deploy machine learning model using Streamlit, Flask, Docker

This project is done as a part of [Project of the Week at DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/edit/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md)

My model accuracy is 72% which is not so good so that I have to retrain after I have finished all the pipeline. 

I have downloaded the trained model in pickle format and after that, I created the virtual environment using anaconda navigator. Inside it, I installed streamlit, numpy, pandas, pickle libraries and write a python script to use streamlit web app. Then I have run the script using "streamlit run 'Deploy_ML/diabetes.py' ".

I have finished streamlit app for diabetes prediction. I have attached the screenshot of streamlit app.
